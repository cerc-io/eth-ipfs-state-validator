[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/vulcanize/eth-ipfs-state-validator)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/vulcanize/eth-ipfs-state-validator)

> Uses [ipfs-ethdb](https://github.com/vulcanize/ipfs-ethdb/postgres) to validate completeness of IPFS Ethereum state data

## Background

State data on Ethereum takes the form of [Modified Merkle Patricia Tries](https://eth.wiki/en/fundamentals/patricia-tree).
On disk each unique node of a trie is stored as a key-value pair between the Keccak256 hash of the RLP-encoded node and the RLP-encoded node.
To prove the existence of a specific node in an MMPT with a known root hash, one provides a list of all of the nodes along the path descending
from the root node to the node in question. To validate the completeness of a state database- to confirm every node for a state and/or storage trie(s) is present
in a database- requires traversing the entire trie (or linked set of tries) and confirming the presence of every node in the database.


## Usage


`full` validates completeness of the entire state corresponding to a provided state root, including both state and storage tries

`./eth-ipfs-state-validator validateTrie --config={path to db config} --type=full --state-root={state root hex string}`


`state` validates completeness of the state trie corresponding to a provided state root, excluding the storage tries

`./eth-ipfs-state-validator validateTrie --config={path to db config} --type=state --state-root={state root hex string}`


`storage` validates completeness of only the storage trie corresponding to a provided storage root and contract address

`./eth-ipfs-state-validator validateTrie --config={path to db config} --type=storage --storage-root={state root hex string} --address={contract address hex string}`


The config file holds the parameters for connecting to an [IPFS-backing Postgres database](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ds-sql).

```toml
[database]
    name     = "vulcanize_public"
    hostname = "localhost"
    user     = "postgres"
    password = ""
    port     = 5432
```
